Topic l_c_d_ panel 
Person A: 
Um they're in the L_C_D_ panel and the jog-dial? Okay 'cause The L_C_D_ panel just displays um functionally what you're doing. It might even be one, a bit more complex L_C_D_ panel with pictures like maybe the sun or the, you know, the the symbols of the various functions. The other thing could be that um you could take away the L_C_D_ panel and the advanced chip together, um because when you do something on the T_V_, the T_V_ responds and reacts as well, so the user could be looking at the T_V_ and pushing his thing so we may not need to so when we scroll we need just some way to get the T_V_ to respond, which I think is a technically doable thing so Yep. It It needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone, underneath there's actually one button underneath, it's just that the panel itself is a single panel. 


Topic chip 
Person A: 
Yeah advanced chip. We need an advanced chip I think, yep. And the advanced chip goes away as well. Regular chip. 
Person B: 
Advanced chip. To be replaced with a regular chip. 


Topic colour 
Person A: 
Yep, colour, sharpness. For the case itself, one colour. It's one special colour. Okay um and maybe a special colour for the buttons, so maybe four again. We just report that it has to be over budget, or the colours, you could take away s colours for th for the buttons. Normal coloured buttons. Um so then these just become normal coloured buttons, so that might be some some way of cutting the cost. The the look and the colour is something which is cool, but I think that there's also that factor of if it's too unfamiliar then um because when you put it on the shelf Yeah button shape might be a good idea to change, rather than rather than positioning, 'cause I think positioning is we're kinda engrained into the the telephone kind of pad. Okay, the blue the blue colours and don't re don't actually represent the colour, except for the b the the red button, they because for want of a Yeah, the the yellow is more representative of the colour, but the button itself, the blue can be anything else. 
Person B: 
Is there any rubber at all in the buttons or any Okay, um and we wanted special colours didn't we? So I'll have to put that Oh no wait we ho how many colours have we got there? Just one colour, okay. Well do you want colour differentiation here? Well that's kind of But the yellow, I mean it could be a lemon yellow colour, couldn't it? 
Person C: 
Is it possible uh I'm just gonna bring up the idea of colours. Is these are these the colours that of production, or is this just what we had available? Mm-hmm, probably colour or sharpness. Yeah um me uh my only reservation with it was that we basically went with yellow because it's the company's colour, and I don't know if yellow's gonna really be a hit. Okay, um Style reflects a fruit inspired colour, design. I shouldn't have said colour, but just Sorta. It's not something I need to p push through, but I thought should we thinking more about the dimensions, um sort of like more of a three dimensional shapes as well as opposed to just that flat um Could our design involve a series of colours so that it's more of like a line where we have like sort of the, I don't know like the harvest line or the vibrant, I dunno the Whatever just some theme and then we have different tones, lime green, lemon. Yeah I th okay on th um yeah dif answering the question uh in those terms I'd say that actually there's sort of a tease of creativity because we're asked to work through this, but actually the guidelines are fairly contrived in terms of um okay fashion trends, say fruit and vegetable colour scheme, but then i then we're told okay use the co company company colours. 
Person D: 
Um you can use it for um more advanced functions like contrast, colour and Um yeah. 


Topic structure 
Person A: 
I think another point is that the meetings um are more brainstorming sessions than meetings, so time is also a very s um strong factor, and structure. Because for a brainstorming meeting you want a structure that allows you to allows ideas to get tossed, um to be evaluated, and to be reviewed, and to get feedback and come back. I think controlling is not the right word, I think the interactions are very structured. I think structure is probably what you're saying that, each individual is structured to one particular task, and one parti rather than controlling. 
Person C: 
Yeah, I mean if you Yeah, I mean sort of taking upon that idea, w the way I see this i is that it's uh the the s the structure in which we've we've approached this whole task is quite contrary to the p principle of teamwork because the the tasks were d d sort of um divided, and then the work went on in isolation I I don't know what you guys did while you were together, maybe that was a bit different, but um yeah, but um but actually if you if you imagine not entire the completely same task given to us but us said okay, first thing we have to do is come up with um let's say um a design concept, and we sit here together and do it, well that's what teamwork is. 


Topic whiteboard 
Person A: 
I think um the the focus of it a lot was the PowerPoint as opposed to the to the whiteboard, and I think that m um is also does you know hinder us and things I think. It will be cooler to have the whiteboard rather than the the PowerPoint, or maybe the whiteboard and the PowerPoint in the same place, you know in the centre of the I think that there were too many PowerPoints in the meetings. 
Person B: 
Okay, um what about the you know how we used the whiteboard, the digital pens, the projector, stuff like that? 
Person C: 
Oh, oh right right, oh right okay room for creativ Oh right I just looked up and saw okay whiteboard, digital pens, the room. I think the whiteboard, for me, is the kind of thing I would use all the time, but it's um not quite as useful as to us as it could have been, maybe just in the way that we we use it, in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings, that could have been up on a board uh you know as opposed to in like in text. But the b the b whiteboard could've actually been this kind of continuing um Think could be, yeah. 


Topic lot 
Person A: 
Um a lot of these things will have to be um free and open for users to define them. 'Cause the plug-in and the plugging spent we spent a lot of time doing that. And a lot of the information on the PowerPoints, I don't think, you know, we needed to actually it could have, we could have gone through it verbally, especially my slides, I felt that they just you know as opposed to having to present them. I think that that's very helpful because it it starts to pop up, whereas on a piece of paper, on a computer, on a board, um even with a three D_ graphic thing it still, it requires a lot of yeah tangible, that's a nice word. 
Person B: 
Well d do you feel though that that you were able to have quite a lot of creative input into the thing? I know I I like to have things written down in front of me actually, like a lot of the stuff that was emailed to me I ended up you know like writing down there or something so I could look at it really quickly and not have the distraction of all of that, um I don't know about anybody else. Yeah I I dunno I think it was quite good that we had time limits on the meetings because they really could have run on and like my experience with meetings is that they really do, and you can spend a lot of time talking about The only thing is though like when we had our meeting about the conceptual design, I thought there maybe another fifteen minutes would have been useful there but um yeah. 
Person C: 
Um it's probably just I dunno if it's worth getting into, but um just in in that we want this to be stylish, should we think a little bit more out of the box in terms of a button grid, because I've seen there's lots of devices out there that that instead of taking your standard nine nine square grid, and they have it sort of stylized or in different concept that that Yeah. 
Person D: 
Um, well look at the expense sheet, and uh it turned to be quite a lot expensive to have open up and have lots of buttons and stuff inside, so instead we've um this is gonna be an L_C_D_ screen, um just a a very very basic one, very small um with access to the menu through the the scroll wheel and uh confirm um button. Um I agree with his point it's um it is quite a lot of fun t to go and then you have sort of hit the end then go right, gotta cut everything out 'cause we don't have enough money. If we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have a quick talk with them, that would've been a lot easier. 


Topic pen 
Person A: 
Yep, left-right balance, um maybe even pre-programmed sound modes, like um the user could determine like a series of sound modes, and then what could happen would be um when you click on that then it would go to that setting. But I think the pen is v is very intuitive, everybody knows how to use it, we don't have to worry. So I think the pen's good. 
Person C: 
That'd be good, in fact a pen is about ten centimetres usually, so that would be that sounds like a really good size, if you see it there. Yep, oh hundred pound pen. 


Topic cool 
Person A: 
It's just, I'm just fiddling with the Play-Doh, and I'm going yeah yeah it's kinda cool. 
Person B: 
Okay cool. Okay cool. Oh no, that's cool, it's got I'm kind of I'm slightly gutted that we couldn't get plastic and rubber, I think that would have been nice. 


Topic number 
Person A: 
That's a number pad. Functionally you're gonna have to intercept So four is a good estimate for Yeah, so you can't actually cut It's like three times the number of buttons, four, eight, twelve. I think that's something that's very hard to catch, so you you restrict the number of people who wanna try something. 
Person B: 
So w why are we arriving at the number four? Where does the number four come from? 
Person C: 
Okay so the number pad is 'Kay, great. 


Topic room 
Person A: 
And I guess that point about the room not being r very friendly to that, I think that's a very big thing, and I think the fact that we're wearing these things restricts I feel it 'cause I wear m my glasses, right, and that but that irritates me right it it it does actually you know affect how, w whether you feel comfortable to communicate. 
Person B: 
So at this point we uh, let me see, discuss uh how satisfied we all are with um with these four points, with the room for creativity in the project, and leadership and teamwork, and the stuff we had around us I guess. But I don't I don't think it means the room as in this room. So still on the topic of room for creativity uh next up is Craig. I really thi i I think maybe if we'd like all been working in the one room, and they just said you know like every hour or something everybody make sure yo you know just have a have a short meeting and then just c just to have like something written down, just like you know a a milestone if you like um rather than having meetings, but There you go. 
Person C: 
The the room uh is fairly institutional, but um the main thing is, I think um our use of this space is more just to report on things as opposed to be creative and constructive and it would probably help to um have l sort of a cumulative effect of we have ideas and we come back and then the ideas are still in discussion, you know, as in other words this this room is sort of a centre point of creativity, whereas in reality as we've gone through this, it's not really the centre point of creativity, it's more just a d debating Yeah, yeah but that's just the thing is the quest in terms of the the first point there, the room, it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave, and then we come here and then we kind of put out our ideas and then, you know. I mean my personal views on on leadership is that effective effective leadership sort of um gives people a certain room for freedom and delegation, but then to come back with something that they take great ownership and you know, innovative thought with. 


Topic logo 
Person A: 
Yeah, company logo. 'Kay I'm I'm listening I'm just trying to incorporate the logo into the the thing, so I'm playing with the Play-Doh as well. Yeah it's just a logo. 
Person B: 
So is that j is that just is that just a logo or does it do anything? Just a logo and then like Ninja Homer, right okay. 
Person C: 
How about with embossing the logo, isn't that going to cost us some money? Okay, logo, we've got it in there, haven't we? 


Topic point 
Person B: 
Um we're at sixteen point eight and Well we h something has to go to the tune of two point t three Euro, so let me see, what are we I mean oh yes sorry, four point three. And so we've got point three to get rid of. So we do have point five Euro to play with if we wanted. Okay we'll s we'll say two point five. Um so yeah project evaluation is this point. I don't know, just um your opinion on those four those four points really and how we used them. Okay uh do you know what, actually let's take each point and everybody discuss it, I think. And point at? 
Person C: 
Uh how mm-hmm how are we going to achieve this high-end product if We only have very sparse Two point three? Four point three no? Okay, so what this is is a set-up for us to um uh use a kind of a like a The idea is that I've set up I've reviewed all of the um the points of discussion from the beginning, and used that as a criteria of evaluation for the um uh for the current design uh th or the plan, and uh so we can review that. 'Kay Let's go with two point five then. We are at uh two, seven, eight, ten, fifteen point five. And so it is leadership almost to the point of sort of disempowering the the the team member, so But it's not bad leadership, it's just sort of s fairly strong, you know. I know that people who design cars and you know in aviation they quite often just have a simple like fibreglass prototype and it's completely you know um abs abstract from the final product, but they use it as a kind of a context to sort of walk around and puzzle and and point and discuss and and and in a way everybody's as we discuss things in the in theoretically and out of our notebooks, we're just we're actually just each of us discussing something that's in each of our own minds. It wasn't until we had this here, you know, like at one point I peeked across and looked at Craig's paper and I'm like, now I know what he's thinking 'cause I saw his book. 
Person D: 
Good point. 


Topic bit 
Person A: 
Yeah, so then you have a bit more freedom to You you still have your blue fingers. Say it's more medium, but going towards a little bit higher than medium kind of thing. It doesn't tell you, you know, some ways that you might wanna be a bit more creative in terms of the process you know, not the I think you tried to use the common share folder to to to to communicate, but um it just comes back to us so slow in the email um it it doesn't have a, you know, a messenger will go. Having to tick it before you go off was a bit hindering as well, 'cause you're half way through a thought, and then you run out of paper and then you have to jump. 
Person B: 
Okay, um so um to s to to summarize the teamwork issue, saying that if we could communicate outside the meeting, you know just like quick questions, quick thoughts, whatever, it probably would be bit easier. 
Person C: 
Maybe a bit higher? A bit more. We've used mostly plastic in the end so it's going to be quite a bit of a compromise for price. 
Person D: 
I'm not sure if that counts but You can see we're we're all very far beyond the Well we could take out ones by making it single curved, just fill in those bits. Uh, reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting. Oh they're a bit clunky. 


Topic sort 
Person C: 
Uh I think it's gonna end up being sort of elementary because we're sort we're in n we're not gonna probably use it to change anything but Doesn't seem like it's going, does it? Uh and I'm gonna write up our results on the board, so this'll be a way for us to go through and decide if we're um sort of review where we stand with it. Okay, so um So to sort of b bring together two things, sort of design goals and also the market research that we had, uh when we rate this, one is v high in in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low, okay. Or sort of our work on setting this up. We're told okay um think in terms of style and look and feel and technology, but build something for twelve and a half pounds, so actually the creativity was more more of like a um a f sort of a f formality then an actual Yeah within the constraints the Yeah. Yeah, well well I mean my sense on that is sort of what kind of guidance and direction, encouragement Yeah from and you as well I think, just sort of acting as team leader. It turns it turns the individual into more of like a um sort of a predetermined mechanism, as opposed to a sort of a free Yeah, oh yeah, without without a doubt. To s to say okay go off and don't talk to each other, it's actually p sort of predisposes you to quite the contrary of teamwork. Um, and then we could then keep our ideas sort of building on that. Yeah, because the PowerPoint was provided to us while we had time to prepare, whereas I can imagine if I'd been encouraged to use Paintbrush, for example, or whatever, I would've actually used it, um 'ca you know, just 'cause that's sorta how we what we were set up to to use while we had our time. So, that's kind of a new idea for me is like just sort of that idea, well you know it's kind of s hard to keep f working forward on a team a team based project when when you're told you must now work away from your team. 
Person D: 
Well I'm We're gonna have again the the sort of the foggy um yellow from last time that lit up when you pushed the button. Um But um this button um, because it's red it's sort of very prominent, we're gonna use it as uh it can be the power button if you hold it for maybe two seconds it'll send a stand-by signal. Um I think single would just be sort of one sort of oval whereas double is this sort of thing. You see I envision it as being um quite deep sort of deep enough to be comfy to hold in your hands rather than being wide and flat. 


Topic computer 
Person A: 
Yeah we only needed one computer and And the computer may not um be conducive to a meeting because um you tend to look at your computer and wanna have the urge to check something, you know, it's useful but I think too many computers are just distracting. 
Person B: 
Do you think the computers just provide distraction in a meeting? 
Person C: 
And o on the topic of the technology, it just occurred to me that we actually didn't need to move our computers because each computer has all of the files. It just occurred to me that they all We only actually needed one computer. 


Topic button 
Person A: 
'Cause slogans are usually quite small, right, they're not like huge so they're s Say a button's about say a button's about this size, right, so you would still have plenty of space for a slogan, say even for that. Yep so that would be about a centimetre for a button, so one two three four centimetres. Okay let's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one. 'Cause that's one button by its the complexity of twelve buttons. So what that means is that um The twelve buttons that you see there. No that's not the button we're talking about. 
Person B: 
So um just from from last time to recap, we said we were gonna have a snowman shaped remote control with no L_C_D_ display, no need for talk-back, it was hopefully gonna be kinetic power and battery uh with rubber buttons, maybe backlighting the buttons with some internal L_E_D_s to shine through the casing, um hopefully a jog-dial, and incorporating the slogan somewhere as well. Okay so that's like an okay button, right. Like uh oh wait so push button and integrated scroll wheel push okay. Um and we ha where are the four the four push buttons are where exactly now? Twelve buttons. Like is is that one big button or is it twelve buttons, how can it be something in between? Does that mean that one button has a special form or Yeah okay. 
Person C: 
What about button shape? Square buttons? 
Person D: 
Well we want the other buttons to be big enough to push easily with a finger so we reckon maybe that'll be about the same size as the palm of your hand. Um apart from that it's gonna be used as a confirm button for the L_C_D_ screen and you use this as a jog-dial. Um you can skip straight to a channel using these buttons. Um we have um got some push buttons as well. So I reckon we've got one button for this thing 'cause it's just one big sheet of rubber. That's um one piece of rubber but it's gonna have twelve button things underneath so Yeah w Um So I reckon Reckon that probably counts as a special form for the buttons. I think there's just one button so handy. 


Topic meeting 
Person B: 
Well this is the uh final detailed design meeting. And the end result of this meeting has to be a decision on the details of this remote control, like absolute final decision, um and then I'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report. Yeah, yeah if the meeting's over then yeah I guess so. 
Person C: 
In in reality I think here the the different elements of leadership such as the the original b briefing and then the personal coach and the and then you know having having you with your the meeting agenda is actually quite a quite a quite a con confining framework to work within.
